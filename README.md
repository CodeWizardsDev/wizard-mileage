## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

This guide will help you set up the script easily!

### Setting up
1. Download the folder and remove the -main suffix from it. The folder name should be wizard-mileage

### Installing
1. Copy the folder and paste it into your resources folder.
2. Add the following code to your server.cfg. Make sure to place it at the top of the resources list to ensure it's loaded before other resources:
```
ensure wizard-mileage
```
3. Import the `import.sql` file to your SQL Database

### Configuration
1. Open the `config.lua` file in the wizard-mileage folder.
2. Choose your favorite notification system from the list and set it as the default.
3. Choose the preffered distance unit (km or mile).
4. Choose the preffered location for mileage HUD.
5. Change the `Config.VehDB` to your vehicle database table name.
   - `'player_vehicles'` for QBCore & QBox
   - `'owned_vehicles'` for ESX
   - you can change it to your custom table name.
6. Customize other settings as per your preference.
7. Save the `config.lua` file.
